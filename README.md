## About me

I am Ksenia Komissarenko, and my passion for IT began during my university years, where I first immersed myself in the world of technology. After graduation, I continued to advance in this field by completing professional retraining courses at ITMO University in DevOps. These courses provided me with a deeper understanding of software development and operations processes, as well as practical skills in automation and system management.

However, my true passion lies in testing. I believe that thorough testing is crucial for ensuring a high level of user experience and product reliability. Working in testing allows me to leverage my attention to detail and analytical skills to identify and resolve potential issues before the product reaches the user. I am continually striving to enhance my skills and knowledge to make a valuable contribution to the creation of high-quality software and the improvement of user experience.
